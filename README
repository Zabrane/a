This repository contains a stripped down version containing only
the "A" part of "A+".
The immediate purpose was to port A to Cygwin, though the resulting
repo should work anywhere that the full A+ works.
Porting the "plus" portion of A+ to Cygwin would be a much more 
difficult task due to heavy dependence on SVR4 libraries, which
have never been ported to Cygwin.
